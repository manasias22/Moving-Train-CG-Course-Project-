Train arrival and departure is a newly designed computer graphics mini project. 
Train arrival and departure is a newly designed computer graphics mini project. In this mini project, there will be objects like train, signal, and a place called “railway station”. There will be a train in which it will start arriving at the railway station when the signal light “green” is turned on.
It will stop at the railway station when the red light is turned on and the train will not move from the railway station till the user displays the green light in the traffic signal when the green light is turned on then the train will start to depart from the railway station. In this project, there will be night mode and day mode. This is an overview of the project.
